## 🧠 About STEVE

**STEVE** is an AI-powered agent designed to autonomously create and manage **3D assets** for a hybrid **Minecraft x Monopoly-style** game built on the **blockchain**. STEVE bridges the gap between player-driven creativity and scalable world-building by generating terrain, structures, and game elements that live on-chain.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- `pip` or `poetry`
- `.env` file with API keys:

  ```
  PORTIA_API_KEY=

  OPENAI_API_KEY=
  GOOGLE_API_KEY=
  STABILITY_API_KEY=

  SUPABASE_URL=
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
  ```

### 📥 Install Dependencies

You can install dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or with `poetry` if you're using it:

```bash
poetry install
```

---

## 🧪 Running the API Server

Start the FastAPI server using `uvicorn`:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Assumes your FastAPI entrypoint is in `app/main.py` with a variable named `app`.

## 🛰️ Example cURL Request

Here’s how to make a request to STEVE once the server is running:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "scene_description": ""A cherry blossom"",
    "tile_index": 42,
    "neighbours": [11, 13, 7]
  }'
```

### Expected Output:

```json
{
  "uploaded_url": "generated_images/tile-42.glb"
}
```

---

## 💾 Upload to Supabase

Once the 3D model is created, STEVE automatically uploads both the `.png` and `.glb` files to a Supabase bucket and returns a public URL for the 3D asset.
